# Advanced-Graphics-for-Games-CSC8502-2016-17
Graphics game engine based on OpenGL and my coursework about computer graphics.<br /><br />
I implemented mixed skybox which can change with the time and water which can reflect the skybox.<br /><br />
I mixed color with textures on heightmap.<br /><br />
Also some particles.<br /><br />
Here are screenshots about my course work and I continue working on OpenGL to create more exciting features in my another repo called LearnOpenGL.<br /><br />
